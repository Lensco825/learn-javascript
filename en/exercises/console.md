# Console

In JavaScript, we use `console.log()` to write a message (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in `console`. It is mainly used for debugging purposes, ideally to leave a trace of the content of variables during the execution of a program.

### Example:

```javascript
console.log("Welcome to Learn JavaScript Beginners Edition");
let age = 30;
console.log(age);
```

## Math with console
You can also write math equation in `console` in order to know the answer to an expression.

### Example:
```js
console.log("What's the age a decade later?");
let age = 30;
console.log(age + 10);
//returns 40 in the console
```

### üìù Tasks:

*  Write a program to print `Hello World` on the console. Feel free to try other things as well!
* Write a program to print variables to the `console`.&#x20;
  1. Declare a variable  `animal` and assign the dragon value to it.
  2. Print the `animal` variable to the `console`.
* Write a program to print the number `45` with a math expression of your choice. 
    * Bonus if one of the numbers is a variable





### üí° Hints:

* Visit the [variable](../basics/variables.md) chapter to understand more about variables.
* Visit the [operators](https://javascript.sumankunwar.com.np/en/numbers/operators.html) page to know the possible math operators you can use.
